# TheOneProfile [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Y8Y66XZTG)
This addon forces supported addons to use a single account-wide configuration profile on every character, greatly cutting down on the amount of time spent setting up addons on new characters.

**CAUTION: When installing this addon for the first time, log on to your best set up character FIRST. All supported addon settings will be copied from that character.**

**CAUTION: At this time there is no configuration options.**

Currently supported: Blizz EditMode, AceDB based addons, SexyMap
